# ðŸ§  My React Learning Roadmap

I'm learning React by building components from scratch, one step at a time â€” from the basics to advanced concepts. This roadmap helps me stay consistent and track progress.

---

## ðŸŒ± Level 1: Basic Components (Props + JSX)
> Learning to build simple, reusable UI components

- [x] âœ… Button component (with props)
- [x] âœ… Alert/Message display
- [x] âœ… Avatar (image + name)
- [x] Badge (dynamic label)
- [x] Card (title, image, description)

---

## ðŸŒ¿ Level 2: Interactivity (State + Events)
> Understanding `useState` and handling user actions

- [x] Counter (increment/decrement)
- [x] Toggle switch (on/off)
- [x] Like button (heart icon toggle)
- [x] Input Mirror (input box, live text below)
- [ ] Dropdown menu (show/hide items)

## ðŸŒ³ Level 3: Forms & Inputs
> Working with form elements and controlled components

- [ ] Controlled input field

### ðŸ“Œ Goal

- âœ… Use props, state, and hooks correctly
- âœ… Write clean, reusable code

---

### ðŸš€ In Progress
Check back as I update this roadmap and check off components I've completed.
